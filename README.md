# NFT Minting JavaScript Program

## Overview
The JavaScript program simulates the minting of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). It allows users to create, list, and track NFTs using basic functions and data structures. 

## How it works
1. Variable to Hold NFTs
The program creates a variable NFTs which is an empty array. This array holds the NFT objects that are created.

2. mintNFT Function
The mintNFT function takes three parameters: name, rarity, and creator. Inside the function, an object is created to represent the NFT, storing the metadata in the object. This object is then added to the NFTs array.

3. listNFTs Function
The listNFTs function iterates over the NFTs array and prints each NFT's metadata (name, rarity, and creator) to the console.

4. getTotalSupply Function
The getTotalSupply function returns the total number of NFTs created, which is simply the length of the NFTs array.

## How to run
1. Copy and paste the code into a .js file.
2. Run the code using Node.js or any JavaScript environment that supports console logging.
3. You can call the functions mintNFT(), listNFTs(), and getTotalSupply() to interact with the NFTs.
